# Palindrome Challenge

## What is a Palindrome?

According to wikipedia, "A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward or forward, such as madam or kayak."

## Premise

With the definition in mind, we are going to create a program that can detect if a word is a Palindrome.

* Your method should take in a word as a parameter and determine if the word is a palindrome. In both scenarios (true or false), it should respond accordingly.
* Your palindrome should be able to handle both integers and strings.

## Test Your Code

Remember. Red, Green, Refactor. You should start this exercise by running the test spec, palindrome_spec.rb (```python palindrome_spec.rb```).

## Challenge Yourself

* Allow your palindrome checker to check against palindromic sentences such as, "Sore was I ere I saw Eros." and "A man, a plan, a canal -- Panama"
